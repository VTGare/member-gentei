# Audit log channel

As a more information-rich alternative to the Discord server audit log, **gentei-bouncer#9835** can post role changes it makes to a configured channel.

For convenient reference by a moderation team, each log message comes with a user's @tagged name, their Discord user ID, and avatar at the time of role change action.
