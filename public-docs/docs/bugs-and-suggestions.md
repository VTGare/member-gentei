title: Filing Bugs & Suggestions
---

To report bugs or make general suggestions, feel free to contact `のヮの＃6969`. I'll let you know if someone's also asked about it before and whether I plan on working on it.

In the near future, I plan on making the Github project backing Gentei publicly available, and with it the `/issues` page for reporting bugs and filing suggestions!
